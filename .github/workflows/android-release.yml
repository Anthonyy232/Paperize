# Paperize CI/CD Pipeline
#
# Automates the testing, building and release process for the Paperize Android application.
#
# Workflow Architecture:
#   1. Test:    Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
#   2. Build:   Compiles and signs the release APK (depends on test passing).
#   3. Release: Publishes the APK to a draft GitHub Release, but only for version tags.
#
# Triggering Conditions:
#   - On push to `master`:
#     - Executes the `test` and `build` jobs.
#     - Produces a versioned build artifact for testing and internal distribution.
#   - On push of a tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`):
#     - Executes all jobs: `test`, `build` and `release`.
#     - Creates a formal, versioned draft release on GitHub with the signed APK attached.
#   - On pull requests to `master`:
#     - Executes only the `test` job to validate changes before merge.
